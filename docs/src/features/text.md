# Text Channels

Text channels provides a chatroom that's typically oriented around a specific topic. Users in the text channel can send, receive, and interact with messages. Text channels are the primary means of communication and are the default channel type.

## Replies

Replies allow a user to reference a prior message in a text channel when sending a new message. The referenced message is typically displayed as a small quote above the new message, along with a link to navigate to that old message in scollback.

## Reactions

Reactions allow users to "react" to a message in a text channel using an emoji. These emojis can either be the standard unicode emojis, or custom emojis defined by the server. [See more about server emojis on their documentation page](./emojis.md).
